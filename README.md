<h3 align="center">A Software Engineer at Red Hat</h3>


<img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/4787_redhat.png" width="20px" height="15px" alt="redhat"> &nbsp; Iâ€™m currently working on the Red Hat Research Team, supporting industry and higher education research projects. I am contributing to various initiatives, including the Open Education (OPE) project and the New England Research Cloud (NERC) within the Mass Open Cloud (MOC). Most recently, I have been focused on AI, where Iâ€™ve been creating and using tools to gather and visualize AI model performance metrics for models deployed in a Openshift/Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) environment. My work has a strong emphasis on Kubernetes and OpenShift, particularly as they relate to AI workloads.
